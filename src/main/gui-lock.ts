 * Process-global mutex for screen-controlling GUI actions.
 *
 * Every Computer Use session joins the same standing mount, but the screen, mouse, and keyboard are
 * process-wide resources: two sessions holding turns at once (a chat abandoned by `newSession` or a
 * history switch, woken again by a `code_agent` completion notice; the main window) would interleave
 * HID actions. The lock state lives on `globalThis` under a `Symbol.for` key so every copy of this
 * module in the process shares one lock, mirroring the select-model queue in `select-model.ts`.
 *
 * Contention fails fast instead of queueing: a queued action would move the user's mouse long after
 * the session lost the spotlight. The thrown error reaches the model as an isError tool result, so
 * it can tell the user and stand down.
